# Mood Tracker System
## Track Your Mood, Track Your Life
A simple web app that lets you track important health measurements like depression and anxiety levels.

## What is it ?
It's a mood tracking app based on the idea of sharing our thoughts between each other.

For those who ask "How are you" and genuinely want a response, there's now a mood-based sharing app that allows friends to catch up on each other's emotional states.

While users' streams on other social media websites feature news articles, cat photos and more objective life updates, YouHue is a sharing app specifically for broadcasting users' states of mind. The app lets users choose from a range of emotions, including excited, romantic, confused and stressed. Each emotional update is accompanied by an optional and brief explanation of the source of the mood. Friends can respond with encouragement, advice and empathy.

YouHue is more than just a sharing app: it can also function as a very helpful mood-logging app for individual users. Users can view a timeline of previous moods and identify patterns and motivations in their emotional changes.
